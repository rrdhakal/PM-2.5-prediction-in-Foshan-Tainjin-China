# PM-2.5-prediction-in-Foshan-Tainjin-China
This project was completed for CEE 254 at Stanford University . I have implemented various Machine Learning models to leverage air quality and weather data from static and mobile sensors in Foshan and Tianjin (China) to make short term/long term predictions and interpolations. The dataset used to calibrate the models is a courtesy of faculties from Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University, and the professional partners from Environmental Thinking.
